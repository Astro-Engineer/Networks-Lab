# Networks-Lab

Things to do:
-Change Broadcast into a function
-Change priority into a local global variable (per node)


Bugs:
-When adding a new lowest number priority, the program cannot handle the messages, probably something to do with the locking?
-Subnet Mask only works with /24 IP addresses, need to fix this
